        <p>The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide support
          for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power Distribution
          Units, Automatic Transfer Switches, Power Supply Units and Solar Controllers.
          NUT provides a common protocol and set of tools to monitor and manage such
          devices, and to consistently name equivalent features and data points, across
          a vast range of vendor-specific protocols and connection media types.</p>
          <p>
          NUT provides many control and monitoring <a href="{root=.}/features.html">features</a>,
          with a uniform control and management interface. If you are just getting acquainted
          with NUT, <a href="{root=.}/features.html">that page</a> also explains the technical
          design and some possible set-ups.</p>
          <p>
          As of this publication, at least @COUNT_HCL_MANUFACTURERS@ different manufacturers,
          and @COUNT_HCL_MODELS@ hardware device models are known as
          <a href="{root=.}/stable-hcl.html">compatible</a>.</p>

<div class="title">Two NUT websites</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <a href="https://networkupstools.org/">main NUT site</a> should closely follow
current development, with documentation most relevant for users who build NUT
from <a href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/">source code</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://networkupstools.org/historic/">Sub-sites</a> are available for some
historic releases for users of NUT packaged with their operating system
distributions. Such packages are typically based on official releases of
NUT at the time of distribution, and may lag behind current development
in terms of features, capabilities, bug-fixes and supported devices.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some data, such as devices with known support at the time of release, are
published to reflect both current development and historic releases; other
data such as the NUT DDL or source archives are release-agnostic and only
published once and for all.</p></div>
