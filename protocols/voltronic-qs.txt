General
-------

- All <<queries,inquiry>> and <<commands,control>> commands and UPS's replies are terminated by `<cr>`.
- Valid <<queries,inquiry commands>> will get a reply terminated by `<cr>`:
  * In a UPS's reply, unavailable or not supported data is filled with *`-`*.
  * In a UPS's reply, if some data length is less than the definition, there will be enough *`#`* before the data to reach the expected length.
- Accepted <<commands,control commands>> are followed by action without any further reply.
- When invalid <<commands,control>> or <<queries,inquiry>> commands are sent to the UPS:
  * [[P-protocol-invalid]]<<protocol,P protocol>>:
  ** if the command/query starts with `T`, the device doesn't reply anything,
  ** otherwise the device replies `N<cr>`.
  * [[T-protocol-invalid]]<<protocol,T protocol>>:
  ** the device replies `N<cr>`.
  * [[V-protocol-invalid]]<<protocol,V protocol>>:
  ** the device echoes back the invalid command/query.


[[queries]]
Inquiry commands
----------------

By sending inquiry commands you can get the information you need from the UPS.

NOTE:	To get a valid reply, all data should be captured at the same time when UPS receives an inquiry command.

[[protocol]]*`M`*::	Query UPS for protocol.

Where `X` can be:

- `P` -> P protocol:
  * -> <<P-protocol-queries,inquiry commands>>;
  * -> <<P-protocol-commands,control commands>>;
  * -> <<P-protocol-invalid,handling of invalid commands>>.
- `T` -> T protocol:
  * -> <<T-protocol-queries,inquiry commands>>;
  * -> <<T-protocol-invalid,handling of invalid commands>>.
- `V` -> V protocol:
  * -> <<V-protocol-queries,inquiry commands>>;
  * -> <<V-protocol-invalid,handling of invalid commands>>.

#AB C DE F G HI JKL M N O<cr>
----

NOTE:	One space (Hex: `0x20`) is added between each field for data separation, but no space between multi-byte data.

Where:

`#`::		Start byte
`AB C`::	MCU-detected input voltage (high, `A`, and low, `B`, bytes, V rms) and input voltage ratio (`C`):
		- Input voltage (V) is obtained with the formula: `AB * C / 51 / 256`.
`DE F`::	MCU-detected output voltage (high, `D`, and low, `E`, bytes, V rms) and output voltage ratio (`F`):
		- Output voltage (V) is obtained with the formula: `DE * F / 51 / 256`.
`G`::		Output load level (%):
		- `G` is a percentage of rated load capability, not an absolute value.
		- If there is no output, the value must be forced to 0 %.
`HI JKL`::	Output frequency time count (high, `H` and low, `I`, bytes, Hz) and output frequency ratio (high, `J`, medium, `K`, and low, `L`, bytes)
		- Frequency (Hz) is obtained with the formula: `JKL / HI`.
		- If the frequency is higher than 99.9 Hz, the value must be forced to 99.9 Hz.
		- If there is no output, the value must be forced to 0.0 Hz.
`M N`::		MCU-detected battery voltage (`M`, V rms) and battery voltage ratio (`N`):
		- Battery voltage (V) is obtained with the formula: `M * N / 510`.
`O`::		UPS status (8 bits):
		- `O` is one byte of binary information such as `<b7b6b5b4b3b2b1b0>`, where `bn` is either `0` or `1`:
+
|====
|Bit	|Logic `1`				|Logic `0`
|7	|Utility fail				|Utility OK
|6	|Battery low				|Battery is not low
|5	|Boost or buck mode active		|Neither boost nor buck mode active
|4	|UPS fault				|No UPS fault
|3	|UPS type is line-interactive		|UPS type is on-line
|2	|UPS self-test in progress		|No UPS self-test in progress
|1	|UPS is in shutdown active status	|UPS is not in shutdown active status
|0	|Beeper is active			|Beeper is mute
|====
`<cr>`::	Stop byte

[[P-note]]
[NOTE]
====
To prevent confusion with control characters, in the following cases the original byte is changed:

[cols=".^,^.^m"]
|====
^|Original Hex	|Changed to Hex
|`0x0D`	(CR)	|0x28 0x00
|`0x11`	(XON)	|0x28 0x01
|`0x13`	(XOFF)	|0x28 0x02
|`0x0A`	(LF)	|0x28 0x03
|`0x20`	(SP)	|0x28 0x04
|====

Hence, if you find the `(` character (Hex: `0x28`) between start byte and stop byte, then you should consider also the next byte and check if they make up one of the aforementioned sequences: if so you have to use them both to get the original value.

For example, when PC sends the command `QS<cr>`, the data returned by UPS (in battery mode) is as the following hexadecimal:

----

NOTE:	One space (Hex: `0x20`) is added between each field for data separation.

Where:

`(`::		Start byte
`MMM.M`::	Input voltage (V rms)
		- `M` is an integer number ranging from `0` to `9`.
`NNN.N`::	Input fault voltage (V rms)
		- `N` is an integer number ranging from `0` to `9`.
		- Its purpose is to identify a short duration voltage glitch which causes off-line UPS to go to inverter mode. If this occurs, the input voltage will appear normal at query prior to glitch and will still appear normal at next query.
		- The input fault voltage will hold glitch voltage till next query: after query, the input fault voltage will be the same as input voltage until next glitch occurs.
`PPP.P`::	Output voltage (V rms)
		- `P` is an integer number ranging form `0` to `9`.
		- If there is no output, the value must be forced to `000.0` V.
`QQQ`::		Output load level (%)
		- `Q` is an integer number ranging form `0` to `9`.
		- `QQQ` is a percentage of rated load capability, not an absolute value.
		- If there is no output, the value must be forced to `000` V.
`RR.R`::	Output frequency (Hz)
		- `R` is an integer number ranging from `0` to `9`.
		- If the output frequency is higher than 99.9 Hz, the value must be forced to `99.9` Hz.
		- If there is no output, the value must be forced to `00.0` Hz.
`SS.S`::	Battery voltage (V rms)
		- `S` is an integer number ranging from `0` to `9`.
`TT.T`::	Internal temperature (°C)
		- `T` is an integer number ranging form `0` to `9`.
		- If the value can't be obtained, the field must be filled with `25.0` °C.
`U`::		UPS status (8 bits)
		- `U` is one byte of binary information such as `<b7b6b5b4b3b2b1b0>`, where `bn` is either the ASCII character `0` or `1`:

For example, when PC sends the command `QS<cr>`, the data returned by UPS is as follows:

----
(208.4 140.0 208.4 034 59.9 12.8 35.0 00110000<cr>
----

And it means:

- Input voltage is 208.4 V,
- Input fault voltage is 140.0 V,
- Output voltage is 208.4 V,
- Output load level is 34 %.
- Output frequency is 59.9 Hz,
- Battery voltage is 12.8 V,

#MMM.M QQQ SS.SS RR.R<cr>
----

NOTE:	There should be a space character (Hex: `0x20`) between every field for data separation.

The UPS's response contains the following information fields:

`MMM.M`::		Nominal output voltage (V).
`QQQ`::			Nominal output current (A).
`SS.SS` or `SSS.S`::	Nominal battery voltage (V):
			- `SS.SS` when less than 99.99 V;
			- `SSS.S` for 99.99 V upwards.
`RR.R`::		Nominal output frequency (Hz).

For example, when PC sends the command `F<cr>`, the data returned by UPS is as follows:

----
#220.0 003 12.00 50.0<cr>
----

And it means:

- Nominal output voltage is 220.0 V,
- Nominal output current is 3 A,
- Nominal battery voltage is 12.0 V,
- Nominal output frequency is 50.0 Hz.

[[commands]]
Control commands
----------------

By sending control commands you can control the UPS.

*`T`*::			Invoke a 10 seconds battery self-test and then return to utility.
			- If battery low occurs during testing, UPS will return to utility immediately.
			- Only when UPS is in line mode and battery voltage is not less than 13V/pcs, the command is executed.

[[SnRm]]*`S<n>R<m>`*::	Shutdown (and restore): shut UPS output off in *`<n>`* minutes, wait *`<m>`* minutes and then turn on UPS output again.
			- The UPS output will be off in *`<n>`* minutes, even if utility power is present.
			- If battery low occurs before *`<n>`* minutes, the output is turned off immediately.
			- After UPS shutdown, the controller of the UPS monitors utility power: if utility is recovered, the UPS will wait for *`<m>`* minutes and connect the utility to output.
			- When *`<m>`* minutes expire, if utility has not been restored, the UPS will wait until utility is restored.
			- If UPS is in shutdown waiting status (while *`<n>`* minutes elapse), the <<C,*`C`* command>> can cancel the shutdown command.
			- If UPS is in recovery waiting status (while *`<m>`* minutes elapse) _and_ mains is present, the <<C,*`C`* command>> can turn on the UPS output, but UPS must be held off at least 10 seconds.
			- *`<n>`* is a number ranging from `.2`, `.3`, ..., `01`, `02`, ..., to `09`.
			- *`<m>`* is a number ranging from `0000` to `9999`. If it is `0000`, output won't be turned on, and, if control power can be shut off, then it is turned off immediately.

[[C]]*`C`*::		Cancel the <<SnRm,*`S<n>R<m>`* shutdown command>>.
			- UPS only accepts this command when the <<SnRm,*`S<n>R<m>`* command>> has not been completed.
			- If UPS is in shutdown waiting status (while *`<n>`* minutes of the <<SnRm,*`S<n>R<m>`* command>> elapse), the shutdown command is cancelled.
			- If UPS is in recovery waiting status (while *`<m>`* minutes of the <<SnRm,*`S<n>R<m>`* command>> elapse) _and_ mains is present, the UPS output is turned on, but UPS must be held off at least 10 seconds.

*`Q`*::			Toggle the UPS beeper.
			- When AC power fails, UPS will generate a warning beep to inform the manager. The manager can toggle the warning beep by sending this command.


[[P-protocol-commands]]
P protocol
~~~~~~~~~~

*`CT`*::		This command, though supported by devices that implement the <<protocol,P protocol>>, does nothing.
			As a consequence of that, when this command is sent to the UPS, the device doesn't reply anything (since the command is supported and not invalid, the UPS doesn't return <<P-protocol-invalid,`N<cr>`>>).


Known problems
--------------

The following issues have been reported by some people with `V protocol' devices:

- <<SnRm,*`S<n>R0000`* command>> is known to work as expected (i.e. turn the load off indefinitely) only if mains is present, otherwise, as soon as mains returns the load gets powered.
- After issuing a <<SnRm,*`S<n>R<m>`* command>>, the UPS won't wait *`<m>`* minutes before powering on the load, provided that the following conditions are met:
+
--
* if the load has been previously (no matter how long before) powered off through <<SnRm,*`S<n>R0000`* command>> _and_ powered on through <<C,*`C`* command>> _and_
* if AC wasn't cut after issuing the <<SnRm,*`S<n>R0000`* command>> (i.e. the UPS didn't turn itself off) _and_
* if there's a power outage after issuing the <<SnRm,*`S<n>R<m>`* command>>.

In this case, as soon as mains returns the load gets powered.
