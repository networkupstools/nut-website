Network UPS Tools website
=========================

This repository contains the scripts needed to generate the
link:https://www.networkupstools.org[NUT website].

Since it was originally part of the
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/[NUT source tree],
it shares some history, and you can save some bandwidth if you
already have a copy of the NUT repository downloaded:

----
:; git clone --reference /path/to/nut \
    https://github.com/networkupstools/nut-website.git
----

Once you have cloned the nut-website repository, you can initialize the
submodules, and pull your copy of NUT into the website tree as well:

----
:; git submodule init
Submodule 'ddl' (https://github.com/networkupstools/nut-ddl.git) registered for path 'ddl'
Submodule 'nut' (https://github.com/networkupstools/nut.git) registered for path 'nut'
:; git submodule update --reference /path/to/nut nut
...
----

Required Packages
-----------------

You will need a copy of `AsciiDoc` toolkit, `a2x` (part of AsciiDoc), and
its dependencies for MAN, HTML and PDF document formats generation (including
`dblatex`, `xmllint`, and `xsltproc`). Current version requirements will be
listed in the output of the `./configure` script. To build the Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL) page, you will need either the `simplejson` or `json`
Python module (the json module that comes with Python 2.7 will work) and the
`lxml` module. You will also need `autoconf` and `automake`, and possibly
`libtool` since the NUT module uses it.

[NOTE]
======
With recent Ubuntu/Debian releases, Python2 is deprecated so much that `pip2`
tool seems to be no longer packaged. If you have both `python2` and `python3`
installed, you may have install modules by `pip3` or APT and to either declare
the preference via environment variables for NUT and NUT-Website `configure`
and other scripts, or change system-wide default symlink to `python` once:

----
:; sudo apt-get install python3-pip
:; python3 -m pip install lxml simplejson pycparser pathlib

### Note: Newer Python releases can suggest to use APT packages for modules
### too (note also that "pathlib" may be not available this way, and may be
### in fact part of the base Python distribution); in this case:
:; sudo apt-get install python3-{lxml,simplejson,pycparser}
----

and then either system-wide:
----
:; sudo apt-get install python-is-python3
----

or constrain the preference to nut-website builds:
----
:; PYTHON='/usr/bin/env python3' ./ci_build.sh
----
======

The `source-highlight` package is optional, but if available, will be used by
AsciiDoc for syntax highlighting of examples.

The optional `htmlproofer` tool from https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer
project can be used to sanity-check links and similar aspects of the markup in
generated HTML pages. On Debian/Ubuntu systems you can install it as a package:

----
:; sudo apt-get install ruby-html-proofer
----

[NOTE]
======
If your `htmlproofer` runs complain like this:

----
htmlproofer 3.19.2 | Error:  "\xC3" on US-ASCII
  /usr/lib/.../nokogiri/html5.rb:389:in `encode': "\\xC3" on US-ASCII (Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError)
----

Try exporting `LANG` and `LC_ALL` environment variables to use UTF-8 capable
locales (already handled in the `Makefile.am` targets by `HTMLPROOFER_ENV`);
this may further require installing some or all locale packages, e.g.:

----
:; sudo apt-get install locales-all
----
======

GNU `make` and GNU `coreutils` are recommended, but if you see any remaining
non-portable constructs in the Makefiles, please let us know.

Building
--------

Editing the Makefile.am source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WARNING: Due to lines which `# HIDE FROM AUTOMAKE #` some GNU syntax which
conflicts with automake syntax, you *MUST* use `autogen.sh` to re-generate
the practical `Makefile` during development cycles. If you rely on automatic
typical regeneration of `Makefile.am` -> `Makefile.in` -> `Makefile`, the
resulting file can have crucial parts commented away.

Alternately, `make unhide-from-automake` after edits, e.g. to fiddle with
spell checker Makefile recipes for historic releases:

----
:; make unhide-from-automake ; make spellcheck NUT_SPELL_DICT=nut-website.dict
----

Quick builds for CI and developer iterations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Main rituals for re-builds should now be handled well by a single script:

----
:; ./ci_build.sh
----

For maintainers (or CI agents) who may push the web-site codebase, further
envvars may be useful to commit changes locally, and to push index upwards:

----
# To publish automatically use:
:;   export CI_AUTOCOMMIT=true
:;   export CI_AUTOPUSH=true

# Optionally (on CI) to avoid rebuilds in cases when Git sources did not
# change after a pull of all nut-website and submodule HEADs (returns exit
# code "42" then, to be handled by the caller):
:;   export CI_AVOID_RESPIN=true

# Optionally - for the rare historic-release sub-sites (by NUT tag), e.g.:
:;   export NUT_HISTORIC_RELEASE=v2.7.4
----

Also, to make sure that syntax of `nut-ddl` data dump files is not ambiguous,
you can tell their parser to abort in case of doubts:

----
:;   export NUT_DDL_PEDANTIC_DECLARATIONS=True

:; ... make ...

Manual building in detail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----
:; ./autogen.sh && ./configure && { make -k ; make ; }
----

NOTE: There are currently some issues with parallel builds (e.g. `protocols`
sub-directory should be built before `OUTDIR` but target dependencies do not
say so). Please run `make` sequentially for the time being.

The root of the website will be in the `output/` directory, if all goes well.

Building release-version sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every once in a while NUT has releases :) and those end up packaged in many
operating system distributions or equivalent bundles of binary code, and are
used by the majority of NUT users.

While the main nut-website now aims to follow the active development based on
current "master" or "main" branches of the components involved, we also publish
reference sub-sites with static data (man pages, configuration, compatibility
information, etc.) for those people to see about setting up their practical
systems properly. Such pages are marked with a note on top that they represent
an old and immutable codebase which may differ from modern project state.

This also impacts some but not all pages of the nut-website as well -- e.g.
the `stable-hcl.txt` file which is a wrapper to include `nut/data/driver.list`
info, but not all of the main website files currently (just because it is too
cumbersome to partially check out arbitrary old codebase to build with current
updated recipes). Likewise, general markup and footers, etc. remain from the
current nut-website codebase at the time of (re-)generation.

In particular, the NUT DDL pertains to all NUT releases (reports the tested
release in the filenames) so is not published separately per historic release.

Normally this should be done once per release, with a call like this:

----
:; export NUT_HISTORIC_RELEASE=v2.7.4
:; ./autogen.sh && \
    ./configure --with-NUT_HISTORIC_RELEASE=${NUT_HISTORIC_RELEASE} && \
    { make -k dist-sig-files || make dist-files; } && \
    { make -k ; make; }
----

Which would populate e.g. `output/historic/v2.7.4` subdirectory that would be
copied and committed into same-named path under `networkupstools.github.io` as
detailed below. Generation of the main nut-website would also populate an index
file of the "historic" subdirectory, based on `historic/index.txt` contents,
to refer to such officially published snapshots. This index is currently
maintained manually, to ensure human decision about publishing (or hiding) an
historic release (especially a release candidate) vs. experimenting with that.

NOTE: NUT v2.8.2 release and earlier used a `LAYOUT=web-layout` design, while
newer releases use `LAYOUT=bootstrap`; these may have to be nudged into `make`
arguments above (note also renaming of `website.txt` to `index.txt` and less
content inside -- some paragraphs were evicted to `index-jumboinfo.html` as
"jumbotron integration") or passed as environment variables to `ci_build.sh`.

NOTE: `make dist-files` should update the historic release site source tarballs
and related ChangeLog, news and checksum files IFF the release data was not yet
there. You probably need to commit that back to "source" github repository.

NOTE: For hardcore maintainers, there should be a PGP/GPG key to also sign the
release tarball, calling `make dist-sig-files` (would fail without a key).

Sanity-checking the generated HTML files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the `htmlproofer` tool is installed (see above) and detected by the
`configure` script (automatically for presence in `PATH`), you can explicitly
call `make check-htmlproofer` to validate the files present in `OUTDIR_BASE`
and/or `OUTDIR` (if stored separately from the base for custom or historic
website builds).

You can also validate the published website repository (into which you would
upload the generated `OUTDIR` contents) as e.g. prepared by the `ci_build.sh`
using `make check-htmlproofer-OUTDIR_PUBLISHED` (optionally customize the
`OUTDIR_PUBLISHED` environment or `make` variable to point to the checkout
location for that repository, if not using the scripted default).

Note that this check can take about 10 minutes (especially if not disabling
the referenced external site availability), so it is not done by default.
You can pass custom `HTMLPROOFER_OPTIONS` to the `make` operation, if desired;
consider pasting the `HTMLPROOFER_OPTIONS_URLSWAP` in that case.

Publishing
----------

NOTE: These are internal notes for the maintainers.

The build result is published to the
https://github.com/networkupstools/networkupstools-master.github.io[NUT
github.io master site repository]
as well as news maintenance on
https://github.com/networkupstools/networkupstools.github.io[NUT
github.io latest-release site repository]

Hence, the rolling master site publication is as easy as:

----
:; git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/networkupstools-master.github.io
:; rsync -avPHK ./output/* /path/to/networkupstools-master.github.io/
----

Release site publication is much less frequent. It follows the master
site guideline when making a release, but only requires updating the
`index.html` file when `news.txt` is updated, as noted below.

NOTE: Be careful to use `git mergetool -y` to merge the updates from
a newly generated `index.html` into the release site, to keep intact
the title (marked with comments) which specifies the type of site.

----
:; git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/networkupstools.github.io
:; cp -R ./output/index.html /path/to/networkupstools.github.io/
:; (cd /path/to/networkupstools.github.io/ && git difftool -y)
----

NOTE: Maybe also update the `ddl` and `stable-hcl.html` on master site,
as its updates often reflect newly confirmed support of devices by
existing NUT releases.

Updates
-------

If you only have a small patch (fixing a typo or wording), don't feel
obliged to install all of the dependencies listed above just to test it.
Feel free to create a pull request on this repository, or (less preferable
as slower to process) send the patch as an attachment to the
link:https://www.networkupstools.org/support.html#_mailing_lists[nut-upsdev list].

Maintainer note: Publishing became part of NUT CI farm automation in 2022,
so whenever master branch sources of relevant repositories are changed,
the website should not lag behind too long. Needed behavior is defined in
this repository in `Jenkinsfile-infra` file, with job history visible at
https://ci.networkupstools.org/view/InfraTasks/job/nut-website/

* As of this writing, changes of `nut-website` repository should get picked
  up quickly thanks to "web hooks" sent by GitHub to NUT CI farm servers,
  and changes in NUT, NUT-DDL and other repositories involved would be
  evaluated every 3 hours.

* (Re-)builds of historic sub-sites for release candidates etc. are handled
  manually by maintainers, to publish source tarballs as well (in nut-source
  repository, in the web-site, in GitHub releases page), and generally happen
  once per such release with a spell like this:
+
------
:; CI_AUTOCOMMIT=true CI_AUTOPUSH=true \
   NUT_HISTORIC_RELEASE=v2.8.0-rc3 LAYOUT=web-layout \
   ./ci_build.sh
------

* The `nut-website` specific spell-checking is handled with a dynamic mix of
  original `nut/docs/nut.dict` and custom `nut-website.dict.addon` with key
  words specific to files in the website (including HTML and asciidoc markup).
