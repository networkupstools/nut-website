[NOTE]
.Two NUT websites
====
The link:https://networkupstools.org/[main NUT site] should closely follow
current development, with documentation most relevant for users who build NUT
from link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/[source code].

link:https://networkupstools.org/historic/[Sub-sites] are available for some
historic releases for users of NUT packaged with their operating system
distributions. Such packages are typically based on official releases of
NUT at the time of distribution, and may lag behind current development
in terms of features, capabilities, bug-fixes and supported devices.

Some data, such as devices with known support at the time of release, are
published to reflect both current development and historic releases; other
data such as the NUT DDL or source archives are release-agnostic and only
published once and for all.
